Scramjet v4.22 brings requested `all` and `race` methods, v4.23 fixes the TypeScript API for some optional parameters.

New methods are:

* `DataStream..all` - processes a number of functions in parallel, returns a stream of arrays of results.
* `DataStream..race` - processes a number of functions in parallel, returns the first resolved.

The new methods follow a similar logic to Promise.all and Promise.race.

A simple example of this is calling a couple URLs in parallel for each entry:

```javascript
  const fetch = require("node-fetch");
  const {DataStream} = require("scramjet");
  const {reportLocally} = require("./lib");

  DataStream.from(data)
    .all([
      (entry) => fetch(entry.reportURL),
      (entry) => fetch(entry.dataURL),
      reportLocally
    ])
    .consume();
```

A similar effect can be achieved with promises:

```javascript
  DataStream.from(data)
    .map(
      (entry) => Promise.all([
        fetch(entry.reportURL),
        fetch(entry.dataURL),
        reportLocally(entry)
      ])
    )
    .consume();
```

`race` method works similarly to `Promise.race` so simply continues whenever the first of all transforms resolves. This could be useful when we just want to confirm one of some things happened, like this:

```javascript
  DataStream.from(data)
    // we don't care which report is done first as long as at least one is.
    .race([
      reportLocally,
      reportRemotely
    ])
    .consume();
```
