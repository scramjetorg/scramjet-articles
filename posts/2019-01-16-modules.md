Scramjet `modules` are node modules that allow you to easily reuse a chain of transforms and even publish it for others to use. In this article we'll drill down on ways to write and use modules.

Module usage
==============

Let's start with absolute basics, how modules are used based on [scramjet-hello-module][1]:

A module needs to be installed with this simple shell command:

```shell
$ npm i scramjet-hello-module
```

Then we use it by passing it to the `use` method of any Scramjet stream.

```javascript
DataStream
  .from(someSource)
  .use("scramjet-hello-module", argument1);
```

Modules will work also on any standard node.js stream:

```javascript
import hello from "scramjet-hello-module";

hello(myStream, argument1); // returns a new stream
```

You can also use modules that are not published in NPM or in node_modules:

```javascript
  stream.use("./my-parse-module") // will look for a file in the same directory as the file where it's used.
  stream.use("/path/to/some/module") // will look for a certain path
  stream.use("my-module/submodule") // will in node_modules/my-module/submodule.js
```

Finally sometimes you may want to use multiple modules:

```javascript
DataStream.from(someSource)
  .use("./find-names")
  .use("scramjet-hello-module", argument1)
  // ... and so on.
;
```

Developing a module
=====================

As an example we'll use a module that converts the stream enteries to numbers and filters out non-numbers.

**Basics first** - it's all in a simple file:

```javascript
module.exports = require("scramjet").createTransformModule(
  stream => stream
    .map(x => parseFloat(x))
    .filter(x => isNaN(x))
)
```

If you save it as `./only-numbers` you can use it in your code to filter out non-numbers from any of your streams in the specific project you put your file in. That's it, you're done, use it and have fun...

### But what if you need to use this module in another project?

Fair question. Why not make an actual node module out of it - what you need is a `package.json` and somewhere to store it - a git repo works well.

Create a directory and put your `only-numbers.js` file.

```shell
# create your local git repo
$ git init .

# add your remote (create it on github or wherever you like)
$ git remote add origin git@your-git-hosting.com:yourname/yourmodule.git

# Answer some questions here and you'll get a nice package json.
# make sure that the answer to "entry point: (index.js)" is "only-numbers.js"
$ npm init

# Add commit and push
$ git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit" && git push
```

You'll end up with a module in git that should have the following files:

```
\
 |- .git/               # this is where your git files sit
 |- only-numbers.js     # this is your actual scramjet module
 |- package.json        # this is where your git files sit
```

### Can I fork something to develop my module quicker?

Sure! Here's a repo made especially for you: [signicode/scramjet-module-hello](https://github.com/signicode/scramjet-hello-module).

### What if my module is good for public?

I congratulate you sir! Now this is fairly simple:

```shell
$ npm publish
```

But please consider doing a couple things first:

* Read the [npm guide on publishing packages][3] - this will make you package stand out.
* Consider adding some checks like `Snyk` so that you keep your package up to date.
